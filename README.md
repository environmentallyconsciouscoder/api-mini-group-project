## Project description

Our MVP is an API backend for a music record shop. The backend system will store information about the records in stock, allowing us to query this data using various criteria such as title, year, genre, artists, and stock levels. Additionally, we have implemented functionality for updating and deleting records.

The project is developed using Java, Spring Boot, H2 database, postgresql, lombok, JUnit 5, and Maven.

We made the assumption that the "genre" field is represented as an enum rather than a string. This decision is based on the assumption that the frontend will feature a dropdown menu with predefined values for selecting a genre.

## Installation

Please ensure that you have Java and Maven installed on your computer. To run the unit tests, use the command 'mvn test'.

## Approaches

We are a team of 3, and our approach to the task begins with designing the API structure and service layer functionality. Next, we have collaboratively code the solution, with one team member taking the lead as the driver.
